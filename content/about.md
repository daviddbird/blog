description: What is Hugo?
title: About
---

This is a place for sharing useful things I find in R that if I don't document somewhere, I'm likely to forget. If this helps anyone else it's a bonus.

This site is built using a Hugo theme called Minimal and written in RStudio using Blogdown and served using Netlify.

Hugo may be the ideal website creation tool with nearly instant build times, able to rebuild whenever a change is made.
